                        In 1757 Kashmir came under the control of Ahmed Shah Durrani,
                        the Afghan who invaded India many times. In 1819 Kashmir was 
                        annexed by Ranjit Singh and made a part of his Sikh empire. 
                        The two Anglo-Sikh wars fought between the Sikhs and Ranjit
                        singh resulted in the complete extinction of the Sikh 
                        sovereignty in Kashmir.

                        What is the real story of Kashmir?
                      A succession of Hindu dynasties ruled Kashmir until 1346,
                      when it came under Muslim rule. The Muslim period lasted 
                      nearly five centuries,ending when Kashmir was annexed to 
                      the Sikh kingdom of the Punjab in 1819 and then to the 
                      Dogra kingdom of Jammu in 1846.
